               <p>In 2022, we launched a digital literacy awareness programme in collaboration with the Delhi government. The programme focused on creating awareness amongst students about digitalisation and the impact it can have in a post-Covid world. For this programme, we focused on children between the ages of 14 and 18 studying in classes 8th-12th grade. As these children will soon have to prepare for their entrance exams, Covid has significantly impacted their education. We wanted to help these students by teaching them how the internet

              <p class='digital_content'>During this programme, we taught them how to use browsers such as Google Chrome to find materials that could be useful for their studies. The students were also taught how to create presentations, videos and emails, which should help them prepare for the real world. Since most of these children come from underprivileged backgrounds, we wanted them to excel in this competitive world and be prepared for better jobs by teaching them these skills. So we partnered with 137 schools that share the same vision of helping these children succeed. We also wanted them to </p>

              <p class="digital_content">see their education beyond the classroom, because the internet is a great way to learn new skills. For example, many educators post their study material and lectures on YouTube, which can help students prepare for their exams. Our goal was to show them how the internet can help them become self-reliant.</p>

               <p>In year 2023, we decided to start school for underprivileged student. But before school, we started summer camp for every children to gain trust of parents that NGO’s school can also provide quality education & facilities. In summer camp we gave different activities to children, which will be helpful for their physical development as well as cognitive development. It was mainly for children aged 3 years to 10 years. Extra-curricular activities are very beneficial for children’s mental growth. Activities performed by children in summer camp are dancing, rhymes singing, colouring, zumba, food preparation without fire & many more. We aimed for 25 children in summer camp but we achieved more than that, total 34 children got admissions in summer camp. This was not only limited to children even we asked their parents for suggestions how we can improve and also implemented. Parents were satisfied with summer camp that their children are learning new things which are making them more understandable and conscious to their surroundings. Some of parents suggested us to organize sessions like this for children</p>

               <p >The ultimate aim of this project is to empower disadvantaged children by providing them with the necessary resources and support to break the cycle of poverty. By enrolling these children in school and providing them with everything they need, from clothing and school materials to tutoring and medical facilities, we aim to give them a dignified and happy childhood. </p>

               <p class="bharta_school_content">In addition to basic necessities, we are also focusing on the mental health of these children by organising sports and play activities, excursions, and other events to help them feel more stable and secure. We want to create a safe environment where children can learn new things and develop positive habits.</p>

               <p class="bharta_school_content">Our goal is to provide education that is on par with the facilities offered by private schools. We want to ensure that these children have access to the same opportunities as their more privileged peers. We are providing grooming sessions and looking for sponsors to help us offer this service.</p>

               <p class="bharta_school_content">We also offer training to teachers to ensure that they have the necessary skills to provide the best possible education to our students. We are also planning to provide counselling sessions for both students and parents to help them navigate the challenges of growing up in difficult circumstances.</p>

               <p class="bharta_school_content">Our efforts do not end with our own school. We aim to send each and every child to good schools so that they can take advantage of opportunities that would otherwise be out of reach. We also plan to incorporate technology by providing projectors for story time, fun time, and learning.</p>
               
               < p class="bharta_school_content">We invite you to join us on this project and make a difference in the lives of these children. You can visit us anytime and stay connected with us through our social media handles. Together, we can create a brighter future for these children and help break the cycle of poverty.</p>
