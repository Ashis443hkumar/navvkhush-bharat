               <h3>WE PLAN TO TEACH FASHION DESIGNING TO 25+ WOMEN BY HIGHLY SKILLED TRAINERS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH EMPLOYMENT.</h3>
               <p>Our organisation has plans to offer a comprehensive training program in fashion designing to a group of 25+ women. This program will be conducted by highly skilled trainers who are experts in the field of fashion designing. The program will cover a wide range of topics, including design concepts, fabric selection, garment construction, pattern-making, and more.
                Our aim is to provide these women with the knowledge and skills they need to become successful fashion designers. Through this program, we hope to empower them to pursue their passion for fashion and create their own successful businesses in the industry.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we recognize that employment opportunities are essential for these women to become financially independent and support themselves and their families. Therefore, we plan to provide them with employment opportunities in the fashion industry after completing the program. This could include internships, apprenticeships, or even job placements with established fashion brands or designers.</p>
